# Testing the Extension Locally

This guide walks you through testing the Crates Autocomplete extension in Zed.

## Prerequisites

- Zed editor installed
- Rust installed via rustup
- This extension repository cloned/downloaded

## Step 1: Build the Extension

The extension has already been built! The WebAssembly file is located at:
```
target/wasm32-wasip1/release/crates_autocomplete.wasm
```

If you need to rebuild:

```bash
# Add WebAssembly target (only needed once)
rustup target add wasm32-wasip1

# Build the extension
cargo build --target wasm32-wasip1 --release
```

## Step 2: Install as Dev Extension in Zed

### Option A: Using Zed UI (Recommended)

1. **Open Zed**

2. **Open Extensions Panel**:
   - Press `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P` (Command Palette)
   - Type "extensions"
   - Select **"zed: extensions"**

3. **Install Dev Extension**:
   - Click the **"Install Dev Extension"** button at the top
   - Navigate to this directory: `C:\Users\radu0\Desktop\Code\Rust\crates_autocomplete`
   - Select/Open the folder

4. **Verify Installation**:
   - You should see "Crates Autocomplete" in your extensions list
   - It should show as "Dev" or "Development"

### Option B: Manual Installation

Copy the extension to Zed's extensions directory:

**Windows**:
```bash
mkdir -p "%APPDATA%\Zed\extensions\installed\crates-autocomplete"
xcopy /E /I . "%APPDATA%\Zed\extensions\installed\crates-autocomplete"
```

**macOS**:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/Library/Application\ Support/Zed/extensions/installed/crates-autocomplete
cp -r . ~/Library/Application\ Support/Zed/extensions/installed/crates-autocomplete/
```

**Linux**:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/zed/extensions/installed/crates-autocomplete
cp -r . ~/.config/zed/extensions/installed/crates-autocomplete/
```

## Step 3: Create a Test Project

Create a simple Rust project to test with:

```bash
# Create a new Rust project
cargo new test-crates-extension
cd test-crates-extension

# Open in Zed
zed .
```

## Step 4: Test the Extension

### Test 1: Crate Name Autocomplete

1. Open `Cargo.toml` in Zed
2. Go to the `[dependencies]` section
3. Start typing a crate name:

```toml
[dependencies]
ser
```

**Expected**: Autocomplete suggestions showing "serde", "serde_json", etc.

### Test 2: Version Autocomplete

1. Type a crate name and start the version:

```toml
[dependencies]
serde = "1.
```

**Expected**: Autocomplete showing available versions like "1.0.228", "1.0.227", etc.

### Test 3: Features Autocomplete

1. Add features to a crate:

```toml
[dependencies]
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["
```

**Expected**: Suggestions for available features like "derive", "alloc", etc.

### Test 4: Outdated Version Warnings

1. Add an old version:

```toml
[dependencies]
serde = "1.0.100"
```

**Expected**: A diagnostic/warning indicating the crate is outdated

### Test 5: Inlay Hints

1. With valid dependencies, you should see inline hints showing:
   - Latest available versions
   - Update recommendations

## Step 5: Check Logs

If something isn't working, check the Zed logs:

1. **Open Command Palette**: `Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + P`
2. Type and select: **"zed: open log"**
3. Look for messages related to:
   - `crates-lsp`
   - `crates-autocomplete`
   - Language server errors

Alternatively, run Zed from terminal with verbose logging:

```bash
zed --foreground
```

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Loading

**Symptom**: Extension doesn't appear in the extensions list

**Solutions**:
1. Check that `extension.toml` is valid TOML
2. Verify the wasm file was built: `ls target/wasm32-wasip1/release/*.wasm`
3. Restart Zed completely
4. Check Zed logs for errors

### No Autocomplete Appearing

**Symptom**: No suggestions when typing in Cargo.toml

**Solutions**:
1. Verify you're in a `Cargo.toml` file
2. Check the file is in a valid Rust project (has Cargo.toml at root)
3. Try manually triggering autocomplete: `Ctrl+Space`
4. Check if `crates-lsp` is starting (check logs)
5. Ensure proper TOML syntax

### Language Server Not Starting

**Symptom**: Logs show errors about crates-lsp

**Solutions**:
1. The extension will try to download crates-lsp automatically
2. You can manually install it: `cargo install --locked crates-lsp`
3. Check your internet connection (for downloading)
4. On Unix systems, check file permissions: `chmod +x crates-lsp`

### Download Failures

**Symptom**: Extension can't download crates-lsp

**Solutions**:
1. Install manually: `cargo install --locked crates-lsp`
2. Check GitHub is accessible
3. Verify your platform is supported (Windows x64, macOS Intel/ARM, Linux x64/ARM64)

## Testing Different Scenarios

### Test with Multiple Dependencies

```toml
[dependencies]
serde = "1.0"
tokio = { version = "1.0", features = ["full"] }
axum = "0.7"
```

### Test with Workspace Cargo.toml

```toml
[workspace]
members = ["crate-a", "crate-b"]

[workspace.dependencies]
serde = "1.0"
```

### Test with Build Dependencies

```toml
[build-dependencies]
cc = "1.0"
```

### Test with Dev Dependencies

```toml
[dev-dependencies]
criterion = "0.5"
```

## Advanced Testing

### Custom Configuration

Create or edit `.config/zed/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "lsp": {
    "crates-lsp": {
      "settings": {
        "inlay_hints": true,
        "diagnostics": true,
        "needs_update_severity": 3
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Zed and test with different configuration values.

### Performance Testing

Test with a large Cargo.toml:

```bash
# Clone a large Rust project
git clone https://github.com/tokio-rs/tokio
cd tokio
zed Cargo.toml
```

Check that:
- Autocomplete is still responsive
- No significant lag
- Language server doesn't crash

## Success Criteria

The extension is working correctly if:

âœ… Crate names appear in autocomplete
âœ… Version numbers are suggested
âœ… Features are autocompleted
âœ… Outdated dependencies show warnings
âœ… No errors in Zed logs
âœ… Language server starts automatically
âœ… Works across different dependency sections

## Reporting Issues

If you find bugs during testing:

1. Check the logs (`zed: open log`)
2. Note the exact steps to reproduce
3. Check your Zed version
4. Open an issue with:
   - Description of the problem
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Log output
   - System information

## Next Steps

Once testing is complete:

1. Make any necessary fixes
2. Update documentation
3. Consider publishing to Zed extensions registry
4. Share with the community!
